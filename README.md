# 🌟 Holy Paladin DPS Simulator

## Overview
The Holy Paladin DPS Simulator is a Java-based backend tool designed to help World of Warcraft (WoW) players simulate and optimize their damage rotations for the Holy Paladin class. It allows users to input character stats and simulate real-world abilities, talents, and gear effects, ultimately providing recommendations on the best ability rotation and estimating Damage Per Second (DPS) output.

## 💡 Motivation

As a dedicated **Holy Paladin** player, I recognized a significant gap in the tools available for simulating damage outputs, especially compared to other classes. This limitation motivated me to develop a tailored simulator that not only benefits my gameplay but also serves the broader community of Holy Paladin players. By enabling users to optimize their builds and analyze performance, I aim to enhance the overall gameplay experience.
