# Holy Paladin DPS Simulator

## Overview

This project is a **Java-based rotation simulator** for optimizing the performance of my Holy Paladin in World of Warcraft (WoW). It provides a way to simulate Holy Paladin damage and healing rotations by using different spells, talents, and gear setups. The simulator outputs DPS calculations and helps analyze different builds in real-time using a **React frontend** that visualizes DPS changes.

The frontend is built with **React** and uses **Framer Motion** for smooth animations. It allows you to input your Paladin's stats (Intellect, Crit, Versatility), choose specific talents (like *Herald of the Sun* or *Lightsmith*), and simulate DPS changes dynamically.

## Features

- **Real-time DPS Simulation**: Input your character stats and simulate DPS rotations in real-time.
- **Stat Customization**: Modify main stats like Intellect, Crit, and Versatility to see how changes affect DPS output.
- **Talent Selection**: Switch between key talents like *Herald of the Sun* or *Lightsmith* and observe their impact.
- **Java Backend**: The backend is written in Java to handle spell rotations, cooldown management, and damage calculations.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React, the UI allows easy customization of character stats and provides animated results using Framer Motion.
