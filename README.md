This project is a **Java-based rotation simulator** for optimizing the performance of my Holy Paladin in World of Warcraft (WoW). It provides a way to simulate Holy Paladin damage and healing rotations by using different spells, talents, and gear setups. The simulator outputs DPS calculations and helps analyze different builds in real-time using a **React frontend** that visualizes DPS changes.

The frontend is built with **React** and uses **Framer Motion** for smooth animations. It allows you to input your Paladin's stats (Intellect, Crit, Versatility), choose specific talents (like *Herald of the Sun* or *Lightsmith*), and simulate DPS changes dynamically.

## Features

- **Real-time DPS Simulation**: Input your character stats and simulate DPS rotations in real-time.
- **Stat Customization**: Modify main stats like Intellect, Crit, and Versatility to see how changes affect DPS output.
- **Talent Selection**: Switch between key talents like *Herald of the Sun* or *Lightsmith* and observe their impact.
- **Java Backend**: The backend is written in Java to handle spell rotations, cooldown management, and damage calculations.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React, the UI allows easy customization of character stats and provides animated results using Framer Motion.

## Motivation

As a dedicated Holy Paladin player, I noticed the lack of existing tools to simulate damage outputs like those available for other classes. This limitation prompted me to develop my own simulator, enabling not just myself but other players to optimize their builds and enhance gameplay.
