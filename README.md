The **Holy Paladin DPS Simulator** is a **Java-based** rotation simulator designed to optimize the performance of the Holy Paladin class in **World of Warcraft (WoW)**. This project allows players to simulate various damage and healing rotations using different spells, talents, and gear setups, providing real-time output for **DPS (Damage Per Second)** calculations.

### 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - **Java**: The backend is implemented in Java, handling the logic for spell rotations, cooldown management, and damage calculations.
  - **Java Libraries**: Utilizes libraries for timers and data manipulation to accurately model game mechanics.

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React**: The frontend is built with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface for inputting character stats and selecting talents.
  - **Framer Motion**: Implements smooth animations to enhance the user experience during DPS simulations.

## 💡 Motivation

As a dedicated **Holy Paladin** player, I recognized a significant gap in the tools available for simulating damage outputs, especially compared to other classes. This limitation motivated me to develop a tailored simulator that not only benefits my gameplay but also serves the broader community of Holy Paladin players. By enabling users to optimize their builds and analyze performance, I aim to enhance the overall gameplay experience.
